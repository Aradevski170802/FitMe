      <!-- <h1>Popular Diets</h1>
    <p>A healthy diet is essential for good health and nutrition.
      It protects you against many chronic noncommunicable diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer.
      Eating a variety of foods and consuming less salt, sugars and saturated and industrially-produced trans-fats, are essential for healthy diet.</p>

    <div class="diet">
      <h2>Ketogenic Diet</h2>
      <p>The ketogenic diet is an extremely low-carb, high-fat eating plan that is similar to the Atkins and low-carb diets in many ways.
        It entails significantly lowering carbohydrate consumption and substituting fat for it. Your body enters a metabolic condition known as ketosis as a result of this carbohydrate restriction.
        Your body becomes highly effective at burning fat for energy when this occurs. Additionally, it causes the liver to produce ketones from fat, which the brain may use as fuel.
        Blood sugar and insulin levels can be significantly reduced by ketogenic diets. This has various health advantages in addition to the elevated ketones.</p>

      <h2>Mediterranean Diet</h2>
      <p>The Mediterranean diet is based on the traditional meals that people used to consume in France, Spain, Greece, and Italyâ€”all nations that border the Mediterranean Sea.
        The diet does not have any set rules or restrictions, 
        although it usually promotes the consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and heart-healthy fats. Refined grains, processed meals, and added sugar should all be limited.
        The Mediterranean diet can aid in weight loss and protect against heart attacks, strokes, type 2 diabetes, and early demise, according to several research.
        For this reason, persons seeking to enhance their health and guard against chronic illness frequently turn to the Mediterranean diet for advice.</p>

      <h2>Vegan Diet</h2>
      <p>The vegan diet has gained a lot of traction. For ethical, environmental, or health reasons, an increasing number of people have chosen to adopt a vegan diet.
        This kind of diet may enhance heart health and blood sugar management, among other health benefits. If losing weight is one of your goals, it might also aid in that.
        However, consuming just plant-based foods may occasionally make you more likely to have vitamin shortages.
        This comprehensive beginner's guide to the vegan diet fills that need. It strives to provide all the information you require to pursue a vegan diet in a healthy manner.</p>
